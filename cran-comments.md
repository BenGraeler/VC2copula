## Resubmission

Jelena Saf notified me about issues in the DESCRIPTION file:
- the Description field was too short,
- Benedikt Graeler is named as author of a function, but not in Authors@R.

To fix this, I
- extended the Description field to give a comprehensive, but concise 
  explanation of the package's functionality,
- list Benedikt Graelers as "ctb" in Authors@R.

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 16.04 (release)
* Windows Server 2019 (release)
* macOS-catalina (release, devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note
