The goal of VC2copula is to extend the 'copula' package with families and models 
from 'VineCopula'. This functionality was previously part of 'VineCopula',
but is now provided as a stand-alone version.

## Installation

You can install the released version of VC2copula from 
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("VC2copula")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(VC2copula)
## basic example code
```
